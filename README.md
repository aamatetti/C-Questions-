# C-Questions-

Q: What is a namespace?
    Generally the first code in a c# program after using statement, used to organize large programming projects, and helps programmers organize their classes. 
Q: What are value types?
 	  Variables that can be directly assigned a number value, such as int, float or long.
Q: What are reference types?
    Variables that aren't directly assigned a value, but store reference to other variables, such as bool or class.
Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
    Used to make code more concise when making property declarations  
Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
    It simplifies the code you have to write and calls the dispose method when the program is complete. 
Q: What are dynamic type variables?
    Variables that do not have a specific type and avoid compile time type checks. 
Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
	  Used to dynamically check whether an object is compatible with a type.
Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
  	A class that allows you to define classes and methods with a placeholder 
Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
	  Its member functions and variables are exposed to other functions 
Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
	  Yes you can, by using the params keyword a function will accept multiple arguments
Q: How do you sort an array?
	  By using Array.Sort()
Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
	  They allow you to assign null to variables, which would normally cause a compile error
Q: What is an enumeration?
	  A type that consists of a set of named constants, such as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday etc
Q: What is inheritance?
    A feature in c# that allows you to define a base class that provides specific functionality 
Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
  	Multiple inheritance is not supported 
Q: What is the purpose of as operator?
  	Used to perform conversions between compatible reference types and nullable types.  
Q: What is an object?
  	An object is an instance of a class in a program 
Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
  	Class is a reference type whereas struct is a value type 
Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
  	Break is used to end a current loop and continue is used to skip the current loop 
Q: What is this and how is it used?
    Refers to the current instance of the class, it is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.
Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
  	They are used to handle exceptions in a program 
Q: How is exception handling done?
  	Done by using the keywords, try, catch, finally, and throw 
Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
  	Used to execute a given set of statements in a program. 
Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    Arrays are a fixed length and must contain the same data types, whereas ArrayLists are not fixed in length and can contain multiple data types. 
Q: What is an object?
  	An object is an instance of a class in a program 
Q: Define constructor.
  	Is created by default whenever a struct or class is defined 
Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
  	Var can only be used when a variable is declared and initialized in the same statement
Q: What is an abstract class?
	  A special class that cannot be instantiated
Q: What is an interface?
    It contains only the declaration of the methods, properties, and events, but not the implementation.
Q: What is a method?
	  A method is a code block that contains a series of statements.
Q: What is a property?
	  A member that provides a flexible tool to read and write the value of a private field
Q: What is an access specifier?
  	Keywords to specify the accessibility of a type and its members
Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
	  Public access, private, internal, and protected 
Q: What is a collection?
	  Specialized classes for data storage and retrieval.
 Q: What is a Hash Table?
    a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, and a a structure that can map keys to values
